                <h2>Making sense of adaptation actions</h2>
                <p>We've identified {@html $data.stats.actions.total} actions (so far) that are helping Hepburn Shire adapt to climate change. Let's start by representing each action as a little <span class = "action-dot">dot</span> on the screen.</p> 
            </div>
            <div scene = 1 force="ring-outer">
                <p>This seems nice and orderly: {@html $data.stats.actions.total} actions <em>seems</em> reasonable...or is it!? Adaptation actions vary wildly in size, scope and focus: many of actions here have adaptation benefits, but aren't specifically being done to manage climate risks and impacts.</p>
            </div>
            <div scene = 2 act="intro" force = "arrow-down">
                <p>So how can we see how these actions match up to <em>our</em> adaptation needs? How can we tell if what we're doing is effective? Are we doing <em>enough</em>? And are we doing enough in the <em>right places?</em>
                </p>
                <p>This guide walks you through some key ways to view Hepburn Shire's adaptation actions. It won't definitively answer these questions - because 'adaptation' doesn't have a single, measurable goal - but it will hopefully equip you with an understanding of what's being done, where there might be gaps, and potentially where you might be able to help our community adapt to climate change.

                <h2>Actions vs climate hazards</h2>
                <p>There are <strong>four climate hazards</strong> facing Hepburn Shire, each of which increases the likelihood of climate events that pose risks to the community.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div scene = 1 force="cluster-hazard" nodeBase="true" nodeArcs = "false" nodeShapes = "false" nodeShadow = "false">
                <p>We want to see how our actions address each hazard. To begin with, we can <em>count how many</em> actions address each hazard. We could try to position each action near the hazards they are trying to address. But we quickly notice is that there are <strong>actions that address multiple hazards</strong>.
                </p>

            <div act="hazards" scene = 2 force="cluster-center" nodeBase="false" nodeArcs = "true" nodeShapes = "false" nodeShadow = "false">
                <p>So how about we re-design our dots by putting some matching <span class="text-arcs">coloured arcs</span> around our actions. It's a bit busy, but now we can identify which actions address which hazards!

                <h2>Adaptation approaches</h2>
                <p>There are two approaches when in comes to adaptation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> We can <strong>reduce risk</strong>; and</li>
                    <li> We can <strong>increase resilience</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each of these  approaches contains a handful of more specific approaches, and our actions can take multiple approaches. What is obvious is that we want is good spread of actions so that our approach to adaptation is diverse.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div scene = 1 force="cluster-approach" nodeBase="false" nodeArcs = "true" nodeShapes = "false" nodeShadow = "false" >
                <p> We can try to position actions over these two approaches, but we again run into the problem with actions that both reduce risk and increase resilience. There might also be some actions that don't really fit either approach: usually because they're quite 'indirect' or 'high-level'.  
                </p>
            </div>
            <div act="approach" scene=2  force = "cluster-approach-wide"  nodeBase="false" nodeArcs = "true" nodeShapes = "true" nodeShadow = "false" >

                <h2>Actions scale</h2>
                <p>The next lens we'll look at our actions through concerns their <strong>scale</strong>. This is a classification of whether an action is specific to the <em>local</em> Hepburn area, or if the action operates at broader scale of either: a <em>regional</em> level (e.g. Grampians or Central Highlands), the Victorian <em>state</em> level, or at a <em>national</em> level.

                <p>How might we visualise scale? The obvious indicator for scale is size &mdash; maybe we could adjust the overall size of each action? However, <strong>we're interested in how these actions affect Hepburn Shire</strong>, so it doesn't make much sense to visually weight a national action over a local one. So what we'll do is add a subtle, shadow-y ring around the actions that are beyond local scale and move on!

                <p>This diagram shows how actions of different <strong>types</strong> might be connected, and how the knowledge gained from more <em>abstract</em> actions, helps to inform more <em>concrete</em> responses to climate risk.</p>

These areas are another useful lens for assessing how well distributed our adaptation actions are across <strong> areas that matter to Hepburn Shire</strong>.</p>
                <p>For Hepburn Shire, we've added a sixth important focus area of <strong>healing country</strong> to highlight the importance of actions that embrace the views and practices of Traditional Owners to manage climate risk.</p>
                <p>Now of course, many actions address multiple focus areas - so we'll another way to show which actions gravitate to a given focus area. To do this, <strong>you can tap on any of the focus area names to see which actions relate to that area.</strong></p>

                <p>We've looked at different ways to classify and cluster actions that hopefully provides some insight into how they collectively respond to our adaptation challenge. Now we're going to look at ways of evaluating and prioritising these actions.
                </p>
                <p>We start by answering three simple questions of each action that are aligned to key <strong>adaptation criteria</strong>. These are questions that can be answered with a(n emphatic) "yes" or "no", or "unsure". These questions simply consider whether an action is <strong>robust</strong>, <strong>flexible</strong> and/or <strong>viable</strong>.</p>

                <p>We can use our adaptation criteria further to create priority tiers for those actions that met two, one or none of the criteria. This is an imperfect way of stratifying actions but is relatively logical and robust: actions that expected to meet more key adaptation criteria float to the top.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div scene = 2 force="cluster-rating">
                <p>Next, we'll differentiate actions by rating how effective they're expected to be at responding to climate hazards. We've rated each action on the (expected) efficacy of their response to each hazard that it addresses. This is a subjective (1 to 5) rating that accounts for the size and scope of the action: so it takes into consideration how ambitious the action is, and how much it might achieve against the hazards it addresses. We use this process to differentiate actions <em>within their priority tiers.</em>

                <p>What we're left with is a loosely prioritised a view of our adaptation actions!

                <h2>Beyond the adaptation lens</h2>
                <p>We've taken a look at our adaptation actions as a <strong>collective</strong>, through a series lenses and perspectives. We've even tried to assess and rank our actions. But is that enough? Do we now know what to do to adapt to climate change?!
                </p>
                <p>Well unfortunately, like all complex challenges, there are (yet) <strong>more characteristics that need to be considered</strong> that can be equally sophisticated and obtuse. Areas that we haven't 'analysed' here include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>action timing and dependencies and/or mutual exclusivity;</li>
                    <li>synergies (and dis-synergies) of adaptation benefits;</li>
                    <li>the roles of influence and responsibility; and</li>
                    <li>idea that actions can have adaptation co-benefits and unintended consequences.</li>
                </ul>  
                <p>These last concepts are critical to remember as there can be many reasons to proceed or not proceed with an action that have nothing to do with climate change adaptation. Our challenge as a community is not to precisely account for each of these sophisticated characteristics. Instead, we can use our understanding of what makes for a good adaptation response to support and coordinate actions that we are confident will lead to comprehensive and practical adaptation benefits for our community.
