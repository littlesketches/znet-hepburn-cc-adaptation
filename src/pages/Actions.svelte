                <p>We've identified {@html $data.stats.actions.total} actions (so far) that are helping Hepburn adapt to climate change. Let's start by representing each action as a little <span class = "action-dot">dot</span> on the screen.</p> 
            </div>
            <div scene = 1 force="ring-outer">
                <p>This seems nice an orderly: {@html $data.stats.actions.total} actions <em>seems</em> reasonable...or is it!? Adaptation actions vary wildy in size, scope and focus: many of actions here have adaptation benefits, but aren't specifically being done to manage climate risks and impacts.</p>
            </div>
            <div scene = 2 act="intro" force = "arrow-down">
                <p>So how can we see how these actions match up to <em>our</em> adaptation needs? How can we tell if what we're doing is effective? Are we doing enough? And are we doing enough in ther right places?
                </p>
                <p>This guide will walk you through some key ways to look at Hepburn's adaptation actions. It won't definitively answer these questions - becuase 'adaptation' and our 'adaptive capacity' aren't quantifiable - but it will hopefully equip you with an understanding of what's being done, where there might be gaps, and potentially where you might be able to help our community adapt to climate change.

                <h2>Actions vs climate hazards</h2>
                <p>There are <strong>four climate hazards</strong> facing Hepburn, each of which increases the likelihood of climate events that pose risks to the community.

            <div scene = 1 force="cluster-hazard" nodeBase="true" nodeArcs = "false" nodeShapes = "false" nodeShadow = "false">
                <p>We want to see how our actions address each hazard. To begin with, we can count how many actions address each hazard. We can also try to position each action near the hazards they are trying to address. But what we quickly notice is that there are <strong>many actions that address multiple hazards</strong>.
                </p>

                <h2>Adaptive capacity and approaches</h2>
                <p>There are two broad approaches when in comes improving adaptive capacity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> We can <strong>reduce risk</strong>; and</li>
                    <li> We can <strong>increase resilience</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each of these broad approaches contains a handful of more specific types or approaches, and our actions can take multiple approaches. What we want is good spread of actions so that we have a diversified approach to building of capacity to adapt.
                </p>

            <div scene = 1 force="cluster-approach" nodeBase="false" nodeArcs = "true" nodeShapes = "false" nodeShadow = "false" >
                <p> We can try to position actions over these broad approaches, but we again run into the problem with actions that both reduce risk and increase resilience. There might also be somes actions that don't really fit either approach: usually because they're quite 'indirect' or 'high-level'.

                <h2>Actions scale</h2>
                <p>The next lens we'll take to look at our actions through is their <strong>scale</strong>. This is a classification of whether an action is specific to the <em>local</em> Hepburn area, or if the action operates at broader scale of say, the <em>regional</em> level (e.g. Grampians), the Victorian <em>state</em> level, or at a <em>national</em> level.

                <p>How might we visualise scale? The obvious indicator for scale is size &mdash; we could adjust the overall size of each action. However <strong>we're interested in how these actions affect Hepburn</strong>, so it doesn't make much sense to visually weight a national action over a local one. So what we'll do is add a sublte, shadow-y ring around the actions that are beyond local scale and move on!

                <p>We can use our adaptation screening criteria further by creating tiers for those actions that met two, one or none of the criteria. Again, this is a imperfect way of stratifying actions but is relateively logical and robust: actions that meeti more key adapation criteria tend to float to the top.

                <p>The last way we'll evaluate these action is by rating how effective they are at respondin to the climate hazards. We know that every action repond to at least one climate hazard, and so we've rated each action on the (expected) efficacy of their response to each cliamte hazard (and its associated climate events). This is a subjective 1 to 5 rating that accounts for the size and scope of the action, and so does take into consider how ambitious the action is, and how much it might achive. So to reiterate, these are subjective ratings that help us differentiate actions <em>within thier tier.</em>

                <p>***To add: screening for uintended consequnces and the role co-benefits in deciding if an action should be done. This might also link to other paradignms and movements (e.g. circular economy, doughnut economics, environmental economic, resilience etc.)

                <p>Placeholder outro section that would reinforce to the audience that the response to climate change adapation needs to be taken as a collection of actions, working together; and the importance of always revisiting this portfolio perspective of the actions, against the climate risks. This should raise questions about the usefulness of being too dogmatic around prioritisation; and might be.</p>
                <p>
                Coordination is critical however understanding this perspective should hopefully help everyone understand how they can support, contribuute to, and develop new actions that help the community adapt to climate change. Making link to taking a deeper dive into the actions would be good (to to logically lead into the postcard section)
