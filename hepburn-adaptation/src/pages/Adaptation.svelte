                <h2>Climate change adaptation</h2>
                <p>We'll start by acknowledging that the climate is changing - regardless of mitigation efforts, because there's inertia from greenhouse gases that have already been released into the atmosphere - and that as a community, we need be ready for the impacts climate change. Climate change adaptation seems <em>fairly</em> simple then, or at least the goal of it is. Howt you need to know to better understand:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>what we need to adapt to: how climate variables are projected to change and how this increases likelihood of climate hazard events</li>
                    <li>what we mean by climate risk through the potential impact on the community</li>
                    <li>how adaptation can be framed as managing and reducing risk; and increasing our resilience or adapative capacity</li>

                <h2>Measuring how the climate is changing</h2>
                <p>Here we take a look at climate variables and how they're projected to change under different climate modelling scenarios. Climate variables are observations be can see in recognisable weather patterns, like temperature and rainfall: they are easy to grasp and associate with climate hazard events like floods, heatwaves, fires and drought.
                </p> 
                <p>The role of model projections and different climate scenarios will be used to highlight how the occurence of hazard events is expected to increase in every scenario. This reiterates the need to take action to adapt, and how its important that actions are robust and need to perform well under a wide range of climate futures.</p>

                <h2>Exposure, vulnerability and adapative capacity</h2>
                <p>Here we identify the exposure and vulnerability as key drivers of risk. And while exposure to a hazard is relatively easy to comprehend (as it has a tangible 'spatial' characteristic), vulnerabilty is more difficult to define and measure.</p>
                <p>An illustrative example might be to think about climate hazards in the developing world and how ill-prepapred some commiunties are in facing, responding to, and recovering from natural climate disasters. Not only might they ve more exposed to incerasing climate hazards, but (in general) they much more vulnerable than Australian's and their communities and institutions lack what's called '(coping and) adaptive capacity': these include the capcity to anticpate risk, to rspond to risk, and to recover and change. All of these considerations reduce risk and the impact on communities, of climate events.
                </p> 
                <p>The international example is extreme but real. It is easy to then recognise that there are differences in exposure, vulnerability and adaptive capacity between say, regional and urban areas of Victoria. And that that  </p>

                <h2>What does adapatation action look like?</h2>
                <p>This section will emphasise taht not only do we need to take action to adapt to climate change, but that we need a suite of actions need to be well coordinated to respond to risk and build resilience. This is an obious but recurring theme with adapation: that it is a broad endeavaor that overlaps with many of our communities natural goals. In effect, a lot of the activities and actions we are already doing have adapation benefits. And a lot of adpation actions have other benefits (and potentially unintended consequences!)
                </p> 
                <p>We need to be mindful of all of these adaptation concepts and how they might be linked to our existing goals and intitiaves. We also need ot be mindful that there are a lot of differnet actors and stakaholder that are invovled in actions that have adaptation benefits. These actors all operate in their spheres of responsibility and influence; and so when we look at actions, a key goal is to not just look at individual actions, but to understand how all our acitons work together to meet our adpatation challenges.</p>
